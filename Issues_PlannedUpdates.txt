Date of Update: 5/22/21

This will be the project global log until I learn how to use GitHub correctly.

Issues/Fixes Needed
-------------------

    1. Haste stacks not displayed on Stats tab while SteelBones are. Debug tab shows accurate SteelBones and Haste stacks. Identical code to mikebaldi's Steam ModronGUI that properly shows Haste Stacks.

    2. Epic Games Store treats IdleCombos.exe as an instance of IdleDragons.exe. EGS will not allow IC to relaunch during Briv Restart Stacking if IdleCombos.exe is running. Steam does not have this issue. Further investigation needed.

    3. classMemory.ahk indicates that AHK does not support large 64bit integers. See notes of classMemory.ahk for more information. Possible script failures may be due to reads outside of 32bit range and unsigned 64bit integers are processed incorrectly.

Future Planned Updates/Features
-------------------------------

    1. Create secondary NonModronGUI.ahk for memory scripted restarts without Modron Automation from ModronGUI.ahk and ManualModronResetSnippets.ahk from Meviin.
        1a. Create instructions for use of NonModronGUI.ahk.
